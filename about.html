About HotScheme
</h1>

<p>
HotScheme is a Java-based interpreter for the Lisp dialect Scheme.
HotScheme is freely available under the GNU licensing agreement.
It is intended as an exhibit of some of Java's power, a tool that
schools can use to supply students with a Lisp interpreter, and,
ultimately, an interactive Internet programming environment.
